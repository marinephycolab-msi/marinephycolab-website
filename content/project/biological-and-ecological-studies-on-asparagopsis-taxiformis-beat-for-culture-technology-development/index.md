A research designed to generate knowledge on the biology, field ecology, and physiology of the economically important red seaweed *Asparagosis taxiformis* to develop a locally-adapted culture technology for large-scale biomass production. Funded by the Philippine Council for Agriculture, Aquatic, and Natural Resources Research and Development (PCAARRD) of the Department of Science and Technology.
