The diversity and molecular phylogeny of the brown algal family Scytosiphonaceae (Ectocarpales, Phaeophyceae) have recently gained attention, resulting in discoveries and descriptions of new taxa at both genus and species level. These studies, however, were primarily based on cold water taxa and tropical members of the family remain understudied. The Philippines currently has nine scytosiphonacean taxa. Of these, only *Hydroclathrus* and *Rosenvingea* have been investigated based on integrated studies on their taxonomy, molecular phylogeny, and growth and development in culture. Meanwhile, studies on the widely distributed but phylogenetically problematic genus *Colpomenia* remain lacking. This continuing work is aims at investigate the diversity, molecular phylogeny, and in vitro growth and development of the scytosiphonacean taxa within Philippine waters, with special reference to the supposedly circumtropical species *Colpomenia sinuosa*.
