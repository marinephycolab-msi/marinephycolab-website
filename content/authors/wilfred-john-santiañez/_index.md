I am interested in exploring the archipelagic coasts of the Philippines to unravel patterns of (global) marine/seaweed biodiversity. I also enjoy dabbling in seaweeds systematics (i.e., taxonomy, classification, and nomenclature) and molecular phylogenetics. As part of my commitment to support nation-building, I explore and develop culture technologies for underutilized seaweed species for their socio-economic benefits, mentor students to raise experts and leaders in Philippine seaweeds research, and provide extension services such as capacity building training/workshops on (eucheumatoid) seaweed farming, among others. I envision pursuing these lines of basic and applied research for resources management and to support emerging and existing seaweed industries especially within the tropical Pacific.
