Julius is currently working on the field ecology, *in vitro*, and land-based culture of the underutilized, yet economically important red seaweed, *Asparagopsis taxiformis* in Bolinao, Pangasinan. Other than *A. taxiformis*, he is also interested in identifying various species of seaweeds, from greens, browns, and reds. Julius is also regularly involved in the monthly seaweed collections around the Bolinao-Anda Reef Complex, Pangasinan for the G.T. Velasquez Phycological Herbarium (MSI); and in this way, he gets to learn more about the seaweed species and resources in the Philippines.
