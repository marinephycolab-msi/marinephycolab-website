JM is the in-house research assistant under the Marine Phycology Laboratory. His main interests are on seaweed phylogenetics, culture, and biogeography research. He is currently exploring the diversity of the algal families Delesseriaceae, Peyssonneliaceae, Scytosiphonaceae, and Sphacelariaceae in the Philippines as well as establishing baseline information on the life history of select seaweed species in culture. He is currently a recipient of the 2022/2023 Lynn√©Sys: Systematics Research Fund of The Systematics Association and the Linnean Society of London and is also an active marine expedition researcher for the laboratory and the institute. JM also maintains the culture isolates of the University of the Philippines - Marine Macroalgal Reference Culture Collections (UPMMARCC) as well as the voucher specimens at the G.T. Velasquez Phycological Herbarium (MSI).
