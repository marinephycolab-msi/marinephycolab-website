abstract: A new and putatively endemic species of <i>Hydroclathrus</i>,
  <i>Hydroclathrus rapanuii</i>, is described from the geographically isolated
  Easter Island in the southeastern Pacific based on morphological and molecular
  phylogenetic data. It is distinguished from other <i>Hydroclathrus</i> by
  thalli of unevenly furrowed thin membranes, and angular, block-like plurangial
  sori. Our phylogenetic analyses indicated that <i>H. rapanuii</i> is closely
  related to the generitype <i>Hydroclathrus clathratus</i>. We also report on
  the morphology and phylogeny of <i>Chnoospora minima</i> from Easter I. and
  elsewhere in the Indo-Pacific Ocean, noting the previously unreported presence
  of hollow portions in its medulla. Although not collected from Easter I., we
  herein propose the recognition of two new genera, <i>Dactylosiphon</i> gen.
  nov. and <i>Pseudochnoospora</i> gen. nov., based on our three-gene phylogeny
  and their known morphologies and anatomies. <i>Dactylosiphon</i> is based on
  the three species currently assigned to <i>Colpomenia</i> (<i>C. bullosa</i>,
  <i>C. durvillei</i>, and <i>C. wynnei</i>) that are genetically and
  morphologically (i.e. thalli with erect and finger-like tubes arising from a
  common saccate base) distinct from other members of <i>Colpomenia</i>. The
  monotypic genus <i>Pseudochnoospora</i> is represented by the decumbent,
  branching, and inter-adhesive species currently known as <i>Chnoospora
  implexa</i>. With the above proposals, we further increase the genus-level
  diversity of Scytosiphonaceae in the Indo-Pacific Ocean.
