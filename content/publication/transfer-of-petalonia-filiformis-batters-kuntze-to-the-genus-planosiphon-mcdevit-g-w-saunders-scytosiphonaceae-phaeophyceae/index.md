abstract: Recent taxonomic and molecular phylogenetic studies by McDevit &
  Saunders (2017) of Canadian Scytosiphonaceae resulted to the description of
  the new genus <i>Planosiphon</i> McDevit & G.W. Saunders and a new species
  <i>Scytosiphon promiscuus</i> McDevit & G.W.Saunders. The proposal of the new
  genus was made to accommodate a highly supported clade consisting of species
  of <i>Scytosiphon</i> and <i>Petalonia<i/i> with flattened thalli that are
  hollow to partially hollow. Typically, <i>Planosiphon</i> species also lack
  paraphyses (ascocysts) amongst their uniseriate plurangia (McDevit and
  Saunders 2017). Together with the discovery of a new monotypic genus
  <i>Tronoella</i> Santiañez & Kogame (Santiañez <i>et al.</i> 2018), the
  description of <i>Planosiphon</i> increases the number of genera in the family
  Scytosiphonaceae to 12. Comparing the morphologies and life histories of taxa
  that are closely related to <i>Planosiphon</i> suggested that the genus can be
  further defined through the life histories in culture of its members. In
  particular, <i>Planosiphon</i> species have been reported to have
  <i>Compsonema</i>-like prostrate sporophytic thalli that bear only unangia
  \[unilocular sporangia] (Kogame and Kawai 1993, Kogame 1998, Kogame <i>et
  al.</i> 1999).
