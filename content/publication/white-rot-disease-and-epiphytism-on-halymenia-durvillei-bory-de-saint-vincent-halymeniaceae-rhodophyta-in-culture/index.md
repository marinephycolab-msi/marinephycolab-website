abstract: We report herein for the first time the occurrence of a white rot
  disease and heavy infestation of epiphytes on the cultured red seaweed
  <i>Halymenia durvillei</i> in Bolinao, Pangasinan. White rot disease causes
  tissues to decay, weakens the affected branches, resulting in the breakage of
  thalli and loss of biomass. The cause of the white rot disease on <i>H.
  durvillei</i> remains unknown but may be associated with pathogenic
  microorganisms similar to other reported cases of diseases among cultured
  seaweeds. The infestation of the epiphytic alga we identified as
  <i>Neosiphonia apiculata</i> has detrimental effects on the tank-cultured
  <i>Halymenia durvillei</i>, where much of the thalli exhibited stunted growth.
  We hypothesized that the unfavorable environmental conditions preceding the
  infestation may have triggered the uncontrolled proliferation of the epiphytes
  on the cultured <i>H. durvillei</i>.
