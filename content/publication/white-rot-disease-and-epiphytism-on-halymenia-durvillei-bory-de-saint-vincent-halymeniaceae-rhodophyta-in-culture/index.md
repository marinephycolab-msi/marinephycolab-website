abstract: We report herein for the first time the occurrence of a white rot
  disease and heavy infestation of epiphytes on the cultured red seaweed
  <i>Halymenia durvillei</i> in Bolinao, Pangasinan. White rot disease causes
  tissues to decay, weakens the affected branches, resulting in the breakage of
  thalli and loss of biomass. The cause of the white rot disease on H. durvillei
  remains unknown but may be associated with pathogenic microorganisms similar
  to other reported cases of diseases among cultured seaweeds. The infestation
  of the epiphytic alga we identified as Neosiphonia apiculata has detrimental
  effects on the tank-cultured Halymenia durvillei, where much of the thalli
  exhibited stunted growth. We hypothesized that the unfavorable environmental
  conditions preceding the infestation may have triggered the uncontrolled
  proliferation of the epiphytes on the cultured H. durvillei.
